We come to love not by finding a perfect person, but by learning to see an imperfect person perfectly.
The way to love anything is to realize that it might be lost.
Love doesn’t make the world go round. Love is what makes the ride worthwhile.

When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.
Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success. If you love what you are doing, you will be successful.
